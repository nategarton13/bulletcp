Title: Automatic groove identification via Bayesian changepoint detection
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Nate Garton
Maintainer: Nate Garton <nate.garton13@gmail.com>
Description: This package is designed as a dependency to bulletxtrctr,
    which contains functionality to match bullet lands from 3D scans. The bullet matching algorithm
    involves removing data from the groove engraved areas of bullets, and hence groove location identification
    is performed as a data preprocessing step. The bulletcp package includes the functions necessary to 
    perform the groove identification task via a Bayesian changepoint detection method. This will simply be an option
    in the bulletxtrctr function which identifies the groove locations.
