Description: Provides functionality to automatically detect groove locations via a Bayesian changepoint detection method to be used in the data preprocessing step
    of forensic bullet matching algorithms. The methods in this package are based on those in Stephens (1994) <doi:10.2307/2986119>. Bayesian changepoint detection will simply be an option
    in the function from the package 'bulletxtrctr' which identifies the groove locations.
